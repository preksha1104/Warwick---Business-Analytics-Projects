The report focuses on using cluster analysis to differentiate borrower segments, analyze customer behavior, and optimize lending strategies. A dataset of 50,000 observations and 53 variables was processed, and a sample of 500 observations was used for analysis.

1. Data preparation: Removal of missing values and conversion of categorical variables.
2. Factor analysis: Identified six key factors and selected eight important variables.
3. Cluster analysis: Used hierarchical clustering to determine optimal cluster numbers and K-means clustering for final grouping.
4. Validation: External validation confirmed that the clustering approach was effective.

The study identified six borrower clusters with different risk profiles, allowing the company to refine loan approval processes, customize loan products, and improve risk management.

Results Achieved:
1. Six borrower segments were identified, ranging from low-risk, conservative borrowers to high-risk, non-performing borrowers.
2. Hierarchical clustering (Wardâ€™s method) provided the best agglomerative coefficient (0.96), ensuring high-quality clusters.
3. The between_SS/total_SS ratio for K-Means was 45.8%, showing a good degree of separation in clustering.
4. The external validation results were closely aligned, with less than a 5% difference in cluster proportions.

Benefits to the Company
1. Improved Risk Management: Helps the company assess borrower risk more accurately and reduce defaults.
2. Personalized Loan Products: Different loan offerings can be designed for high-income vs. low-income borrowers.
3. Better Customer Engagement: Enables targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.
4. Efficient Lending Decisions: Reduces manual effort in loan approvals by categorizing borrowers into predefined risk segments.
