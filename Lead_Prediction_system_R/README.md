The report focuses on developing a Lead Prediction System for World-Plus, a mid-sized private bank, using machine learning models. The system aims to identify prospective customers for the bank’s new term deposit product.

Technique used:
1. The CRISP-DM methodology (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) was applied.
2. Four machine learning models were tested:
Logistic Regression (LR)
Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF)
Decision Tree (DT)
Random Forest (RF)
3. Feature selection was performed in two steps:
Information Gain function to filter relevant features.
Decision Tree model to finalize key variables.
Data preparation involved handling missing values, standardization, partitioning, and balancing the dataset.

Conclusion
The SVM model was the most balanced and effective model for predicting lead conversion.

Potential Benefits of Using the Lead Prediction Model for World-Plus Bank

1. Improved Lead Conversion Rate
Baseline conversion rate (before model implementation): Typically, cold lead conversion rates in banking range from 2-5%.
Predicted conversion rate using the model: With an optimized lead prediction system, conversion rates could improve to 7-15%, depending on implementation effectiveness.
Estimated improvement: ~2x to 3x higher conversion rate

2. Cost Reduction in Marketing
Traditional marketing approach: Targeting an entire dataset (~220,000 customers) involves high operational costs.
With model-based targeting: The model helps prioritize high-potential leads, reducing unnecessary marketing expenses.
Estimated cost savings:
If marketing costs $10 per customer contact, targeting 220,000 people = $2.2 million.
If the model reduces outreach by 50% while maintaining the same conversion numbers, costs drop to $1.1 million.

3. Increased Revenue from Deposits
If each converted customer deposits an average of $5,000 in a term deposit, additional conversions could lead to:
4,000 new conversions → $20 million in new deposits
12,000 new conversions → $60 million in new deposits
Estimated revenue impact:
Assuming a 2% net interest margin (NIM) on deposits, the bank could earn $400,000 - $1.2 million in annual profit from these new deposits alone.

4. Reduced Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
CAC (cost per acquired customer) could decrease significantly by eliminating low-quality leads.
If the current CAC is $500 per customer, and model efficiency improves targeting by 30%, CAC drops to $350, saving $150 per new customer.
